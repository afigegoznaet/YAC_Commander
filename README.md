# YAC_Commander
I want to create yet another commander, since all Linux file managers are just very unhandy.
This is already my primary file manager in Linux/Xorg.
At the moment it performs all the basic file manager operations, like copy/move/delete/open.
Things to add:
* View file
* Edit destination on file&dir move/copy
* Command line
* selection filters
* directory refresh on change
* chown / chmod
* soft/hard linking
* more informative progress dialog
* progress dialog actions
* Tab persistence
* Some sort of Directory action if a drive is removed(maybe just notification)
* Search capability
* TBU

Implemented sutff:
* File/Directory move/add/delete
* tabs
* Save state on exit
* Disk / Mount points buttons
* asynchronows file/dir movement progress dialog

Known issues:
* Dir doesn't refresh if some action is performed in the other tab
