# YAC_Commander
I want to create yet another commander, since all Linux file managers are just very unhandy.
This is already my primary file manager in Linux/Xorg.
At the moment it performs all the basic file manager operations, like copy/move/delete/open.
Things to add:
* View file
* Edit destination on file&dir move/copy
* Command line
* selection filters
* directory refresh on change
* chown / chmod
* soft/hard linking
* more informative progress dialog
* progress dialog actions
* Tab persistence
* TBU
